Our project is going to be a streamlined menu design app that is deployable to Rasperry Pis and can be used by restaurants to display a dynamic menu on a TV. The user would be able to edit their menu in a web browser using JQuery responsiveness to help keep everything aligned and gives the user an opportunity to make their menu unique.
