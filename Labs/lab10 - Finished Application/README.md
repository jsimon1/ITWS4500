Jeremy Simon - Websci Lab 10

Added a help button for new users to further page branding.
Added visualize view with two graphs using D3, one is a graph representing the tweets across the United States by time zone. The second is a donut graph dividing by the number of followers of the users who tweeted into ranged of low, low-medium, medium, medium-high, and high amount of followers.

I couldn't get the second graph to compile in time so I disabled it. For some reason it smushed together the entire graph and wouldn't expand it. However I did the data transformation and set everything acoording to the library for D3.
